    The hobby that I spend most of my spare time on is gaming. 
    I like to spend my time playing all sorts of games, often 
    with my friends who share my interests. Some of my favorite 
    games include Undertale, Team Fortress 2 and Path of Exile. 
    My interest in videogames is also part of the reason I chose 
    ICT, because one day I would like to make a game of my own.

    <p class="text">
    Sometimes I also like to watch shows, mostly anime, in my 
    spare time, though I don't spend as much time on shows as 
    I do on games. Some of my favorite include Gintama, 
    Hunter x Hunter and Fullmetal Alchemist. A lot of my friends 
    have similar tastes in shows, so I enjoy discussing shows 
    with them.
